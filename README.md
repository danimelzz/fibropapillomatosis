## Abstract 

Fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a neoplastic disease that affects sea turtles. Recent studies revealed that Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is the etiological agent of FP. In this context, parasites of the family Spirorchiidae are hypothesized to be mechanical vectors of ChHV5. In this study, (i) fifty-nine parasites were used to test the mechanical vector hypothesis; (ii) twenty-six lungs from Chelonia mydas captured on the coast of Southeastern Brazil were evaluated in biometric, histopathological, and molecular analyses to investigate the pathogeny of FP and spirorchiidiasis; and (iii) phylogenetic relationships of Spirorchiidae were tested. Biometrics revealed that FP+ turtles exhibited significantly higher body mass, curved carapace length, and curved carapace width than FP- turtles. Histopathology revealed type I spirorchiid eggs affecting the lungs. Although reports of internal tumors have been rare in Brazil, we found a lung fibroma in which there were spirorchiid eggs. ChHV5 was not detected by PCR on parasites, which are suggestive results against the mechanical vector hypothesis. We provided the first 28S sequences of spirorchiids from Brazil, which are important for future phylogeographic studies of Spirorchiidae from the Atlantic Ocean. Our phylogenetic analysis support that neither Spirorchiidae nor Hapalotrema are monophyletic.
